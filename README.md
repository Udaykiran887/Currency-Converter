## Project Overview

### Currency Converter Using Node-RED

The Currency Converter project utilizes Node-RED, a flow-based development tool for visual programming, to create a functional and interactive currency conversion tool. This project is designed to provide real-time currency exchange rates and facilitate the conversion of amounts between different currencies.

### Key Objectives

- **Real-Time Conversion**: Convert amounts between various currencies using up-to-date exchange rates.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Offer an easy-to-use interface for users to input the amount and select the currencies for conversion.
- **Scalability**: Easily add support for more currencies or additional features as needed.

### Components

- **Node-RED Flows**: Visual programming flows to handle data processing and conversion logic.
- **API Integration**: Integration with a currency exchange rate API to fetch the latest exchange rates.
- **User Input**: Interfaces for users to input the amount and select source and target currencies.

### Benefits

- **Efficient Conversion**: Quick and accurate currency conversion with real-time data.
- **Customizable**: Easy to modify and extend the project to include new features or currencies.
- **Visual Programming**: Leverages Node-RED’s visual interface for intuitive development and management.

## Features

### Real-Time Currency Conversion

- **Live Exchange Rates**: Fetches and uses up-to-date exchange rates from a reliable currency exchange API.
- **Multiple Currencies**: Supports conversion between a wide range of currencies.

### User Interface

- **Interactive Input**: Allows users to input the amount to convert and select both source and target currencies.
- **Output Display**: Shows the converted amount in a clear and understandable format.

### Configuration

- **Dynamic Currency List**: Automatically updates the list of available currencies based on the API data.
- **Customizable Rates**: Option to adjust or override exchange rates for specific needs or scenarios.

### Data Handling

- **Error Handling**: Manages errors gracefully, such as when the API is down or if invalid data is entered.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Tracks conversion requests and errors for troubleshooting and optimization.

### Extensibility

- **Modular Design**: Easily extend the project to support additional features, such as historical exchange rates or currency conversion analytics.
- **API Integration**: Flexible integration with different currency exchange APIs if needed.

### Security

- **Secure API Requests**: Ensures that API requests are made securely to protect sensitive data.
- **User Data Privacy**: No personal information is collected or stored during the conversion process.

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Install Node-RED**: Ensure you have Node-RED installed on your system. Follow the [installation instructions](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/) if you haven't already.

2. **Set Up the Project**:
   - Download or clone the project repository.
   - Import the provided Node-RED flow file into your Node-RED editor.

3. **Configure the API**:
   - Obtain an API key from [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/).
   - In Node-RED, update the HTTP request nodes with your API key and endpoint URL as specified in the [API Documentation](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs).

4. **Deploy the Flow**:
   - Deploy the Node-RED flow to apply the configuration changes.

### Using the Currency Converter

1. **Access the Interface**:
   - Open the Node-RED dashboard in your web browser (usually at `http://localhost:1880/ui`).

2. **Enter Conversion Details**:
   - **Amount**: Input the amount of currency you want to convert.
   - **From Currency**: Select the currency you are converting from (e.g., USD).
   - **To Currency**: Select the currency you want to convert to (e.g., EUR).

3. **Perform Conversion**:
   - Click the "Convert" button (or similar) to initiate the conversion process.

4. **View Results**:
   - The converted amount will be displayed on the interface, showing the result based on the latest exchange rates.

### Example Flow

Here’s an example of how a basic flow might look:

- **HTTP Request Node**: Retrieves exchange rates from ExchangeRate-API.
- **Function Node**: Processes the data to perform the currency conversion.
- **UI Nodes**: Displays the input fields and conversion results.

### Troubleshooting

- **No Data**: If you see no results, check your API key and ensure your Node-RED HTTP request nodes are correctly configured.
- **Errors**: Review the Node-RED debug panel for error messages and adjust your flow accordingly.

### Further Customization

- **Add More Currencies**: Modify the API request to include additional currencies if needed.
- **Enhanced UI**: Customize the Node-RED dashboard to improve user experience or add new features.

## API Integration

### ExchangeRate-API

This project utilizes the [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) to provide real-time currency exchange rates for converting between different currencies.

**Key Features:**

- **Real-Time Exchange Rates**: Offers current exchange rates for a wide range of currencies.
- **Reliable Data**: Ensures accuracy and consistency in conversion calculations.
- **Extensive Currency Support**: Covers numerous global currencies.

**How It Works:**

1. **API Requests**: Node-RED makes HTTP requests to the ExchangeRate-API to retrieve the latest exchange rates.
2. **Data Parsing**: The response from the API is parsed and used to perform the necessary currency conversions.
3. **Error Handling**: Includes mechanisms to handle potential issues such as API rate limits or service outages.

**API Documentation:**

For detailed information on how to use the ExchangeRate-API, including request parameters, response formats, and how to obtain an API key, please refer to the [API Documentation](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs).

**Getting Started:**

1. **Sign Up**: Register for an API key on the [ExchangeRate-API website](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/).
2. **Configure Node-RED**: Set up the HTTP request nodes in Node-RED to interact with the API using your API key.
3. **Test the Integration**: Run the Node-RED flow to ensure data is being retrieved and converted correctly.
